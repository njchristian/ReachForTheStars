Wonderful new yoga studio with amazing teachers. Lots of classes to choose from in a much needed area of Glendale."

I have been searching near and far for a studio like this in Glendale, AZ. The studio is gorgeous and impeccably clean, the teachers are very knowledgeable, spiritual, and hands-on. I love that I get a great sweat in while also getting something to think about during that day (something like, taking time to slow down and appreciate what is around you, understanding what your body is telling you during your practice, etc.). This is my favorite yoga studio in Arizona, I highly recommend it to both beginners and more experienced yogis. Tina and Carlos will welcome you with open arms and open hearts."

Great yoga studio! Always super clean and well-organized. The owner and instructors are very passionate about what they do. If you've never done yoga before, this one is very welcoming- no intimidation here! Great if you are more advanced as well."

This place is the best!  Everyone is like family there and the teachers are phenomenal, seasoned and they offer classes at really handy times.  I have yet to take a class that wasn't inspiring and as challenging as I needed.  I have been to almost every yoga studio in North Phoenix/Scottsdale and into Glendale and this is by far my favorite!"
