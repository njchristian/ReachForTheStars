I've had ENVY do 2 drywall repairs from my techs accidently making a boo boo. Work wise they guys are awesome! scheduling is a bit hazy so that's pretty frustrating when trying to coordinate between them & your customers. Pricing, well..... its more than I anticipated but both my customers were extremely satisfied with their performance & you couldn't tell there was ever a blemish. Hats off to ENVY."

Couldn't have been more pleased with the great folks over at Envy Restoration and Construction.  Truly amazing.  A leaky pipe inside my wall damaged both my master bedroom and half of my kitchen which ended up also being an asbestos problem in the drywall. Overall, a 1 month project to restore.  You can imagine not only the mess that this would cause but also the uncertainty about the solution.  Both Kevin and Rosie were prompt, attentive and genuinely focused at ensuring that every need, question and concern that I had was taken care of.  I literally had Kevin's cell number in my own phone and he responded to every phone call or text message. The first time ever I've had a contractor return EVERY ONE of my calls.   Additionally, the quality of work far exceeded my expectations and was done neat, orderly, on time and on budget.  I would and plan on recommending Envy to anyone that will listen.  They absolutely made a tough experience 1000% more bearable."
