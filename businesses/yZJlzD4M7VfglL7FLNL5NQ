The Skin Suite is amazing :) I was always switching estheticians or places , just never happy, until I met Kimbra. Now I have been going to her ever since.\nShe does amazing brazilians . She is friendly and knowledgeable."

Mom and I went to get facials and found this place through Yelp.  We both absolutely loved our facials with Alicia Szolowics.  I'd say it was the best facial I had.  I'll definetly go back when I'm in town again. I'd like to try the dermabrasion."

I found Kimbra on one of the living social deal 2 years ago for Brazilian wax. I was very pleased with her work and continued to see her for several sessions. But due to my crazy schedules, I decided to try another salon(for convenient). big disappointment!  I told Kimbra about my unpleasant experience with other salon, she then did her best to fit me in her book! \n\nRecently, I discussed with her about my over sensitive face & the tendency of braking out. She recommended a facial product to sample to see how my skin will react, and followed by facial treatment (if the product works) Not only she does an amazing Brazilian wax, but she is also excellent on facials & great estheticians!"
