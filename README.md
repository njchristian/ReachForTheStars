To Test the Core Algorithm:

Run "python testCore.py"

You can change the review, and uid (user id) variables to try different reviews.
  To do this pick a review from target reviews. In front of the review is the review_id. You can match these to the appropiate user id manually in businessReviewMap.txt, where the values are, in order, business_id, review_id, user_id.
