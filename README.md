Classify Yelp Reviews By Star Rating

To Test the Core Algorithm:

Run "python testCore.py"
  
  You will need 'targetReviews.txt' and 'businessReviewMap.txt', as well as the coreNaiveBayes.py file.

This will run over 10 arbitrary businesses we identified with low numbers of reviews. It does each one independently right now (ie. super ineffecient), so it will take a while. 

If you want to just run over one review, instead of running main() in testCore.py, run simpleTest().
