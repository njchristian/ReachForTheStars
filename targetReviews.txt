The studio is gorgeous and impeccably clean, the teachers are very knowledgeable, spiritual, and hands-on. I love that I get a great sweat in while also getting something to think about during that day (something like, taking time to slow down and appreciate what is around you, understanding what your body is telling you during your practice, etc.). This is my favorite yoga studio in Arizona, I highly recommend it to both beginners and more experienced yogis. Tina and Carlos will welcome you with open arms and open hearts."]

She blended everything together PERFECTLY, listened to my wants and needs, and left me looking a hundred times sexier! \n\nI don't go to salons as often as I should, since it's hard for me to come up with the money each month - but she provided EXCELLENT service, an incredible cut, and at an unbeatable price. \n\nThe salon itself is fantastic, too - not too cold/hot, nice background music, clean and organized. All the products smell amazing, and I'm put at ease knowing they're not putting nasty things like lye or ammonia or whatever on my hair.\n\nI'll definitely be a returning customer.

Anyone who knows about these type of ext knows that this is crazy , she already had my credit card info for\nThe lash service and charged me another 450$ to destroy my hair , chunks were broken and destroyed , Aiesha response when I asked her to refund my $ or at least replace the $500 hair she ruined , her response was when you left my salon you had extensions so my job was done . No refund it took me 7 hours to do your hair and I will not give a refund (keep in mind I was only there for the hair part for about 4 hours in rich she took about 7 cigarette breaks and a visit from her boyfriend who brought her a \"blunt \" to smoke to help her relax because she was having a hard time w my hair WTF??!!!!  She went on and on about how she was trained and skilled in this new bonding technology when she clearly didn't even know how to use the tool . She was rude and belligerent and completely unprofessional , anyone can rent a spot throw a chair and a mirror up and pretend they know what there doing . Do your research .

I bought a voucher for a full set of Mink eyelash extensions. \n\nCons:\nEyelash fibers are DEFINITELY NOT mink. Very low quality, plastic, hard, crunchy fibers. Once the owner/technician is done, she will try & lie to assure you & say that they will  soften in 24 hours. Lie.\n\nGlue is poor quality. Prepare for red itchy eyes for days (maybe I am allergic to be fair, but I've had eyelash extensions before with no reactions.)\n\nEyelashes started falling out the same day, and I mean with perfect care!!! Worst application ever. Bald within days. Lol. \n\nHer person & finger reek of cigarette smoke, MAJOR NO NO! Just plain eww.\n\nService? Boy oh boy. LOLOLOLOL. She (owner/tech/stylist) really needs to be reprogrammed to include customer service skills. This person has zero. I say person as she was no lady. Far from it. Very abrasive, no manners at all. She was rude upon me walking in, she thought I'd take the treatment but she quickly realized I was no push over so she was no longer from this point rude to me, BUT she was so rude to customers calling in, customers that came in (she even cursed & kicked a customer out). POTTY MOUTH!!! Just filthy! And even talked crap about the customer after she left to me. Argued with this woman for 15 minutes!! Horrible, embarrassing and awkward. Made me wait while she yelled on the phone and complained and cursed with her employee. What...the...heck?! I had to wait 20 minutes to be seen yet the place was a ghost town. \n\nShe really needs to learn about business, ethics, customer service, etiquette. I mean she needs to repeat school entirely as well while I am at it. \n\nI tried to solve the problem with her...my bad application etc, no return calls or emails. So, I got a refund from Groupon IN FULL with their business guarantee. Sucks they had to eat the cost and not her. \n\nThe salon is very makeshift and run down, shack like, but seemed clean enough. \n\nAnd I know salons are known for gossip but they talk about such inappropriate things, & take extra time to have smoke breaks and gossip about Baby Daddies. \n\nPROS\nHmmm...there were free mints?"]

A leaky pipe inside my wall damaged both my master bedroom and half of my kitchen which ended up also being an asbestos problem in the drywall. Overall, a 1 month project to restore.  You can imagine not only the mess that this would cause but also the uncertainty about the solution.  Both Kevin and Rosie were prompt, attentive and genuinely focused at ensuring that every need, question and concern that I had was taken care of.  I literally had Kevin's cell number in my own phone and he responded to every phone call or text message. The first time ever I've had a contractor return EVERY ONE of my calls.   Additionally, the quality of work far exceeded my expectations and was done neat, orderly, on time and on budget.  I would and plan on recommending Envy to anyone that will listen.  They absolutely made a tough experience 1000% more bearable."]

This place is awesome and the teachers and owners are very nice. \n\nThe gym area itself is very clean and spacious. I love that you are not hitting your neighbor with your legs. They offer 2 different kinds of Pilates classes- Extreme Pilates and Bounce Pilates. Both classes will rock your world. You will be in pain but feel so good. =)\n\nThey are also going to start offering Boot Camp and I am sure that will be great. They are offering Grand Opening Specials right now that are really good.

Don't get me wrong, I get the benefits of Classical Pilates--but frankly (YAWN) I feel like I have to work out afterward. Not to mention the price tag. What I love about this place: Low impact, full body resistance training that's fun and over in 45 minutes.  The bounce classes are fantastic! Crazy cardio intervals on mini trampolines and then back to the beds (Proformers). You will feel muscles you didn't know you had and I felt stronger pretty quickly. The instructors are very attentive and welcoming. And as my form  improves I get more out of it. It's even right there next to Albertson's so you can get your healthy grocery shop on afterwards!

They were out of stock of everything including pre-rolls, with the exception of 2 \"top shelf\" strains. one of which was quarters only. You know why you don't sell many quarters? because you ask too much. Offer deals! When you have nothing cheap, offer a special. I'm not a recreational patient, I have migraines, I have back pain, and I do not have a lot of funds. Yes, you have specials that include free pre-rolls. I don't care how great you think your pre-rolls are. Shake is shake. I come to you for full flower, not shake. Happy hour can be 10% off or something. Why are you out of pre-rolls and have nothing but over-priced \"top shelf\" left? Hmmm... Other places are the other way around. They run out of top shelf and have pre-rolls as a \"sorry, here you go, please come back.\" I can think of 5 places off the top of my head that offer halves at 180-200 top shelf that stack up above in quality to your 220 top shelf half. I will NOT be returning and will urge others not to until you reorganize your pricing structure, and be a little more caring to the fact I had to leave with nothing."]

Van Buren St. #1016, Phoenix, AZ\n\nBrewer-Caldwell Property Management\n\nHonestly, I'm shocked that you would allow people to view the apartments/ condos at Red Rox before having them cleaned. They were filthy and it was pretty hard to look beyond that. I looked at all three you had listed. #2059 immediately made me want to throw up when I walked in the front door due to the disgusting toilet. #1016 reeked of cigarette smoke and the carpet was filthy. The only way I would ever rent this unit would be if the carpet and appliances were replaced. I also would rather have my own washer and dryer in the unit. I could have been a long time tenant had the apartment been presented in move in condition.  The only good thing about the complex was the landscaping.\n\nRose Bigley"]
["vwZlEWp-pbZGXjRZVfhZ7w"]	[5, "The whole point about getting an apartment is loving where you live. I love where I live! The location first off, is incredible! Only one mile from a Metro light rail station, the gate is right off a Valley Metro bus line: route 3 Van Buren. The Phoenix Zoo is literally two blocks from here, and you have Tempe Town Lake and everything awesome on Mill Ave in downtown Tempe about two miles away. Even downtown Phoenix and Chase Field is only about ten minutes away, or 5 stops on the Metro rail!\n\nThe inside is rally nice, everything is spacious and very reasonably priced for what you get. Some of the units have slightly older stuff, but they seem to update that pretty quickly as people vacate and new people move in. Even the people we deal with for the property management are fantastic. \n\nThere is a large fountain/pond area that the main pool and workout room overlook and there is even a vollyball court right near the pond. And yes there is a second pool. If you're looking for a new place to live, you really might want to give this a try.

["_pMNrQEADYvP7VJDCkEkpA"]	[4, "I recently moved here and am renting through a private owner. Tip: Renting through a private owner is a lot cheaper than going with the actual Red Rox office. However, owners vary and some don't take care of tenants as well as others. Fortunately, the owner of my unit is really attentive! Coming from the San Francisco bay area, I have to say that these units are amazing - especially for the price!\n\nA few things about the area: it's not the kind of place where you can walk down the street and visit a local coffee shop or diner. You pretty much have to drive to get around. However, it is centrally located, so everything you could need or want is a short drive away. The unit I have has poor water pressure - especially in the shower. The mailboxes are at the entrance, so depending on where you live, you need to take a short walk to check the mail. Those are pretty much it for the cons. Now for the good stuff...\n\nThe 1-bedroom unit I'm in is really spacious. The kitchen has a pantry and is adjacent to the laundry room. Yes, a washer/dryer in the unit is a total plus (and it has shelf space above the w/d to store soap and such)! The bathroom is huge and has a small linen closet inside, along with ample cabinet space. The dining area (which I converted into a home office) has built-in shelves. I'm in love with my new walk-in closet. Also, each room has a ton of outlets! If that weren't enough, there's even a storage space outside in the patio area. My unit came with one covered parking space and there's a lot extra spaces for guests to visit (not covered, though).\n\nThe complex has two pools, a place to rent in case you want to throw a nicely-sized party, and a small gym. They have an on-site office that has limited hours.\n\nThe best part of this place is that it's super quiet! I can't really hear my neighbors and the area is clean and well-maintained.
