Only one mile from a Metro light rail station, the gate is right off a Valley Metro bus line: route 3 Van Buren. The Phoenix Zoo is literally two blocks from here, and you have Tempe Town Lake and everything awesome on Mill Ave in downtown Tempe about two miles away. Even downtown Phoenix and Chase Field is only about ten minutes away, or 5 stops on the Metro rail!\n\nThe inside is rally nice, everything is spacious and very reasonably priced for what you get. Some of the units have slightly older stuff, but they seem to update that pretty quickly as people vacate and new people move in. Even the people we deal with for the property management are fantastic. \n\nThere is a large fountain/pond area that the main pool and workout room overlook and there is even a vollyball court right near the pond. And yes there is a second pool. If you're looking for a new place to live, you really might want to give this a try.

However, owners vary and some don't take care of tenants as well as others. Fortunately, the owner of my unit is really attentive! Coming from the San Francisco bay area, I have to say that these units are amazing - especially for the price!\n\nA few things about the area: it's not the kind of place where you can walk down the street and visit a local coffee shop or diner. You pretty much have to drive to get around. However, it is centrally located, so everything you could need or want is a short drive away. The unit I have has poor water pressure - especially in the shower. The mailboxes are at the entrance, so depending on where you live, you need to take a short walk to check the mail. Those are pretty much it for the cons. Now for the good stuff...\n\nThe 1-bedroom unit I'm in is really spacious. The kitchen has a pantry and is adjacent to the laundry room. Yes, a washer/dryer in the unit is a total plus (and it has shelf space above the w/d to store soap and such)! The bathroom is huge and has a small linen closet inside, along with ample cabinet space. The dining area (which I converted into a home office) has built-in shelves. I'm in love with my new walk-in closet. Also, each room has a ton of outlets! If that weren't enough, there's even a storage space outside in the patio area. My unit came with one covered parking space and there's a lot extra spaces for guests to visit (not covered, though).\n\nThe complex has two pools, a place to rent in case you want to throw a nicely-sized party, and a small gym. They have an on-site office that has limited hours.\n\nThe best part of this place is that it's super quiet! I can't really hear my neighbors and the area is clean and well-maintained. In all, I'm really happy with my new humble abode:)", "yelp_score": "4", "semantic_score": "2"

Why are you out of pre-rolls and have nothing but over-priced \"top shelf\" left? Hmmm... Other places are the other way around. They run out of top shelf and have pre-rolls as a \"sorry, here you go, please come back.\" I can think of 5 places off the top of my head that offer halves at 180-200 top shelf that stack up above in quality to your 220 top shelf half.

Once the owner/technician is done, she will try & lie to assure you & say that they will  soften in 24 hours. Lie.\n\nGlue is poor quality.

Worst application ever. Bald within days. Lol. \n\nHer person & finger reek of cigarette smoke, MAJOR NO NO! Just plain eww.\n\nService? Boy oh boy. LOLOLOLOL. She (owner/tech/stylist) really needs to be reprogrammed to include customer service skills. This person has zero. I say person as she was no lady. Far from it. Very abrasive, no manners at all. She was rude upon me walking in, she thought I'd take the treatment but she quickly realized I was no push over so she was no longer from this point rude to me, BUT she was so rude to customers calling in, customers that came in (she even cursed & kicked a customer out). POTTY MOUTH!!! Just filthy! And even talked crap about the customer after she left to me. Argued with this woman for 15 minutes!! Horrible, embarrassing and awkward. Made me wait while she yelled on the phone and complained and cursed with her employee. What...the...heck?! I had to wait 20 minutes to be seen yet the place was a ghost town. \n\nShe really needs to learn about business, ethics, customer service, etiquette. I mean she needs to repeat school entirely as well while I am at it. \n\nI tried to solve the problem with her...my bad application etc, no return calls or emails. So, I got a refund from Groupon IN FULL with their business guarantee. Sucks they had to eat the cost and not her. \n\nThe salon is very makeshift and run down, shack like, but seemed clean enough. \n\nAnd I know salons are known for gossip but they talk about such inappropriate things, & take extra time to have smoke breaks and gossip about Baby Daddies. \n\nPROS\nHmmm...there were free mints?", "yelp_score": "1", "semantic_score": "2"
